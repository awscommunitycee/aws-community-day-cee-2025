  "abstract": "Generative AI is forcing us to rethink the very foundations of computing—what it means to program, to test, and even to “know.” This talk explores how the shift from deterministic systems to reasoning, agentic models is reshaping development practices, cost structures, and the role of the developer. From context engineering to AI economics, from “vibe coding” to specs-driven systems, we’ll trace the rapid evolution of GenAI and what it reveals about the future of software creation. Join to discover why everything you thought was stable in computing is being rewritten—faster than any technological shift before it.",
