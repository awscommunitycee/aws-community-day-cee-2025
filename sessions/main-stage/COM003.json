  "abstract": "When you build a saas application, starting with single tenant architecture is most of the cases the best option. It provides the speed and flexibility you need. But when the system grows, and when there are more and more consumers added into the system, this single tenant approach, itself can be the bottleneck. In this talk I am going to take you through a real-world use case, how and why one of the mission critical serverless applications in PostNL that was initially designed for single tenants was moved to a multi-tenant approach.",
