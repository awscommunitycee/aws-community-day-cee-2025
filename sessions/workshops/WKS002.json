  "abstract": "In cloud security, intrusions can lead to issues like deleted instances, unauthorized deployments, and exposed credentials. This hands-on workshop uses the AWS Console Mobile Application as a mobile tool for investigating and resolving such incidents. Participants will explore a simulated breach: trace EC2 deployments, review access logs in Amazon CloudTrail, examine logs, and revoke access as needed. You'll also learn about Amazon Q for queries, the AWS Health Dashboard for monitoring anomalies, CostExplorer to monitor costs  and CloudShell for CLI tasks. Attendees will gain practical skills in mobile forensics, containment, and remediation to better manage AWS environments.",
